        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (9 ounce) package brownie mix</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cold water</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) package individually wrapped caramels, unwrapped </li>
            <li>1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk </li>
            <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>Â½ cup white sugar </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
            <li>2 eggs </li>
            <li>1 cup chocolate fudge topping </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                Grease the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan.
                </li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together brownie mix, 
                1 egg and water. Spread into the greased pan. Bake for 25 minutes.
                </li>
            <li>Melt the caramels with the evaporated milk over low heat in a 
                heavy saucepan. Stir often, and heat until mixture has a 
                smooth consistency. Reserve 1/3 cup of this caramel mixture, 
                and pour the remainder over the warm, baked brownie crust.
                </li>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla 
                with an electric mixer until smooth. Add eggs one at a time, 
                beating well after each addition. Pour cream cheese mixture over caramel mixture.
                </li>
            <li>Bake cheesecake for 40 minutes. Chill in pan. When cake is thoroughly 
                chilled, loosen by running a knife around the edge, and then remove 
                the rim of the pan. Heat reserved caramel mixture, and spoon 
                over cheesecake. Drizzle with the chocolate topping.
                </li>
        </ol>
